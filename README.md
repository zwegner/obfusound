Obfusound
=========

This is a partially-working program that I wrote around 2006 (age 18), intended for the IOCCC. It's basically a sound-generating program, implemented by a small virtual machine that executes bytecode and converts the program's output to a .WAV file. Additionally, there is an outer loop that mutates the programs to make different output each time.

There's an assembler included (as.c) and a simple example program (t.a). The main program (s.c) isn't complete--parts are still unobfuscated. And honestly, I'm not really sure what state it's in. Perhaps I'll resurrect it at some point.
